##Mini Rogue

This is just a demo of a creating a rogue-like in Speedie.

I have done it in a kind of strange way... I am directly working on the `message` class to store the world's current state.

Its a bit like having an XML file (jeebox in this case) where you do all work on, rather than work on objects. 

I just did it like this to save lines of code. But I regret it now :D

So if anyone wants to work on this, feel free to totally restructure the project to use proper classes, and a load/save design.
