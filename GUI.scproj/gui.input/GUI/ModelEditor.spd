/*

Modelling system:
	* We want someway to construct better shapes.
	* A text + raytracer interface: 
		* text gets sliders for nums
		* mouse/keys for pos/rotation
		* color-slider
		* etc
	* Composeable too. define subshapes in text.
	* How to do things like clouds? Only code can really specify it. Need speedie recompiles?
	* I think a modeller should be as basic as a text-editor. Ubiquitous.
