		 				FEATURES TO DO


* Reference Count improver
	* Remove opt norefcounts... very bad source of bugs
	* A single final block of decr code... "return" will goto a line within that.
	* disturber implementation. No need to do most refcounts.
	* just create a "Refcount2" system? Dont delete the old refcounter. Just compare the differences.
	* Unified destructor? Subclass by "wrap", all objects go before refcount. Or 64-bit position marker?


* the question is... whether I should do this... or not.
	* I feel like its a good idea? No idea though?
		* It can get bogged down... needing to handle all sorts of wierd issues
		* A good time to do nil-object checking?
			* They would combine by using faster or (no refcounting) if we know an obj is nil or not.
		* We could (should) combine these into my generic "problem solver"!!!! It will be amazing!			


* Nil checking... would eliminate many bugs from my game... like that language "Nice".
	* func abc (|obj| a),		if (a), or || x = a?.b	// a can be nil, cos it's tested
	* func abc (|obj| a),		|| x = a.b				// a cant be nil, untested
	* func abc (|obj?| a),		|| x = a.b				// silently --> || x = a?.b
	* func abc (|message| m),	|| o = m.obj?.oof		// no choice, gotta test it.
														// should we insert tests automatically?
	It will make my VM much easier to debug! Literally 99% of my crash bugs are nil-objs.
	Almost never anything else except "invalid pointer"... from a compiler error... thats fixed.

* Object Type conversion should check the type is correct...


* Better expect syntax! explained in expect.txt
* remove arrays/linkedlists. Use FixedDict+list.
* Static vars?
* struct/array unpacking too.
	* var = {a,b,c}|nameandmsg| // a struct... or even a class? why not?
* ability to create functions that own copies of vars from owning space.
	* fn = % func (value, expr) // or fn = ∆ func val exp
	* rz <~ all~files --> "appends each file into rz"

* auto-create float/int funcs for vecs? (on demand or explicit?)

* vec/array param split?
	* obj.func(P) --> obj.func(p.x, p.y, p.z)

* bit fields?
	* or at least some sytnax to "get inside in a defined bit-ops way"... with names too.
	class whatever
		|u32| Abc bits {
			a : 3
			b : 20
			c : 9
		}

* Replace with string param adder if so few into faststring
* Allow constants for array sizes!
* "||" parsing... requries an "inside |" boolean. What if... instead we use the same func that parses stuff inside of strings? Like... distance based :)

*		expect (obj isa SCDecl) // ideally the test below should be unnecessary
		if (obj isa SCDecl) { use obj as a decl... }

DESIGN FLAWS JUST LEAVE FOR NOW

*		|[int]| S,		.Starts = S
        class X {|[int]| Ints}
                                // Ordering issue...

 .............................................................................. 

							Awkwards

* Why does the compiler make bigger files outside of xcode?
* Restrict default params to being named? like python.
* AddressOf is a bit inconsistant... just make it do whatever it does in C++
* Allows multiple variables of same name!!!! (at different levels) SHOULD NOT!
* Disable require/expect on statements with no effect...	
*        if (a mod b) --> if (a.mod(b))
         if (a in (b, c)) --> if (a.in(b,c))
    without creating new scoperators!

							Actually already good:

* Disable implicit bools object params? (but we wanna keep 1, 2, 3, etc? makes no sense. just allow all or none.)

* int outputs ALWAYS 64bit-correct  (allows compare/add 64/32 bit without typecasts)	

* obj.property().func --> obj.property.func... the () is superfluous, ignored.

* "a:b" I need to change language?

* syntactic comments... actually good! I know the code is a mess... bug that probably means it should be redesigned. It does exactly what it should do! There isn't a simpler way to do it. Just maybe a clearer way.

* lack of #exit... it was buggy and the syntax SUCKED
    "(item) #exit" all over. urgh.

* 
    class bla {
        module {
            |int| i
            function bla {i++}
            // disallow i++, use .i++ ?
        }
        // sure, except... what about accessing "i" from within the class?
        function bla2 {
            i++
            // now it is inconsistant! unless we have MORE syntax like mod.i++
            // it's fine as it is.
            // maybe not?
        }
    }
    
    

* units!!!! @num containing @unit was DUMB!!!! @UNIT should be the top!!!


* "return{bla}" should be allowed? (its to differentiate return() from return ())
		

* tmp vars... do them local per func...
	(seems actually quite hard... because they aren't just created in one spot. It's called from at least 3 widely separated points in the code. So I can’t just keep a global counter because the global counter needs resetting... Also means I need to "Start tmp vars" and then "stop tmp vars" PER FUNCTION in 3 points in the code... before actually doing anything... so now I have...
		fn.StartTmpVars
		DoRefs(fn)
		fn.StopTmpVars
		
		which i s ugly.
		
		it would be better to design it properly, so it always takes a namespace? But that means redesigning a lot of my code...
		* Why not each func just has a "tempvar" counter?
	)
	
	Right now... the tempifier is messing up a lot of var names... seems WORSE after trying to fix this!


* Lack of struct.new    (add "owned/borrowed/shared/virtual" objects instead!)

* Constructors/new are already good! Because constructors inline in C anyhow...

*	msg[0] was finding a func in message[(default params)] instead of list[(exact match)]
	I think this actually is good behaviour... I should just create an error about "Shadowing"... rather than make my compiler awkward.
	
* a = b:c
	BAD... Breaks my parser. In so many ways.

* CNJ efficiency by putting it elsewhere...
	BAD: Old design was better

* a = b #require
	ITS FINE! The only issue is this:
	a = b + (c + D#require)

	nested requires/expects are the issue.
	
* compiler needs to have some way for a datatype func to say "Actually, we need THE ADDRESS OF SELF"
	* useful for saving...
		function LoadProperties (blablabla) {
			pragma AddressOfSelf // implied for structs
		}
		* Can mean I can get rid of value = loader.int or whatever it was...
			.Value.LoadProperties(loader)
			* what about our huge number of datatypes? fail?
				* Yeah, basically...
	* wait till need this anyhow for OTHER REASONS than saving.

* @base... MAKES THINGS WORSE! what about -10? or -0x10?
	where does the "-" go? now we need to do string append just to get the -10 with an "x" base!
	And what about parsing? -10 or 0x10.parseint... works just fine. until we split it all off!
