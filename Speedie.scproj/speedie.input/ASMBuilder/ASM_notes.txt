OK... how how to do the consts... I guess there are 3 goals






* refcounting + const collector
	* not inserting consts "on first use" actually makes optimisation harder.
		* How many instructions are there? looping over to see if an opt improved things... well did it?
			* We want some ways to reduce consts... Like try to use existing consts in registers.
			* check existing consts... then check if an addc or bflg can correct it.
	* perhaps FatASM can store the const output? This means I don't need a separate constfucker.
	* type-casting needs constifiying
	* const injection
