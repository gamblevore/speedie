todo:

* go over ASM and remove a lot of testing code/vars once its working...

* if func returns input param... it doesnt need freeifdead? I mean... assuming we didn't incr while sending it in.

* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
   * get property but only did math
   * mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
   * mark entire class
   * fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
   * check entire program for modification during nil-sweep
