	Nil checking! how to do it
	When to do it
	Where to do it
	AAAAARGH
	so complex to even think about it. OK... so lets start
	
	Now... how do I use it? and when?
	
	I think we need a multi-pass system, and the final pass should follow the code flow.
	
	Passes:
		* Collectdecls: This will set the basic variable qualities of nil or not
			DONE.
		
		* Transform:	This modifies the nilness of params and vars... depending on if they are tested or not
						if/while/ternary/??/?/and/or/expandtobool?
						wrapper-funcs (i guess just declare them as testers)

						if msg
							// msg is now optional
							if msg > nil, if msg != nil // same
							// msg is now optional and NOT nil within this branch
						
						if msg == nil // msg is now optional... but nil within that branch
						if msg >= nil, msg <= nil // what? just fail!
						
						
						
		* NilCheck:		This will create problems or even errors if not used properly
						Do this after transform and before refcount!
						We need to go through the entire program, and give each item found, a "timecode". That is... it has an "earliest time" that it COULD occur.
						So for branches, thats easy, both sides get the same time. We can do some simple logic like:
						
						function abc
							if !inited
								inited = true
								var1 = .CreateVar
								var2 = .CreateVar
							var1.explode
							var2.die
						
						If its only set in one place... that can help.
						
						So var1.explode actually has a "higher time" than var1 = .createvar. So its OK.
						
						Like this... we can make it work!
						
						POSSIBLY we could allow reordering.
						
						while looops are easier, unless they might not fire at all.
						
						function pointers... are a bit trickier?
						
						if (random[])
							a lot of code
							(.func)()
						  else
							small code
							(.func)()

						we have to check the time twice? But thats true of function calls in general???
						We could do it differently... "at each second in time..." there can be an array (or list whatever) of possible code we could be executing. The problem with that, is that it would explode exponentially :)
						
						Perhaps not? if we exclude times that not newer?
							
						
		
		* Strength:		Setting to a definite nil is ALWAYS an error... like: nil|msg|.pos=0
						Strength is settable in the project if its an error or problem
						For now it defaults to problem
		
		* cpp_wrappers:	Params assume not nil unless with "?" Same with all funcs actually.
