	So what do we do?
	we want to do the nil stuff?
	first... perhaps make the nil option a preference?
	so its not noisy on all computers?
	
	OK... so now we can do that... what next?
	
	well... what is next?
	
	im not sure...
	
	we wanna use it?
	
	so... we hav some nil checkrs...
	
	we gotta do this in xcode, cos actually the problem is that a lot of objects have no decl!
