* VM? 
* nil-checking
	* NilSweep, for global vars, and for function misuse.
* make collectdecls not loopy

// Perry Do later
* on build DONT open the build area wider if its already open!!
* SelectedLine on startup is right at the top... so you can't see the lines above :(
	* pasting line-jumping acts different than typing line-jumping

* function jumping should be to a function + a relative line... not bytepos... due to editing of files making things messy.
	* What about decls? perhaps just relative to a node?
* TextView error/find resync
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can


// Speedie Do later
* nicer lookups: fn x (|int| n), .x(max) --> .x(int.max) // assuming max doesn't exist locally.
* "calledfrom" autocomplete needs to include references to funcs
	* calledfrom datatypes too
	* @dot completes to @dotAnyGlobalfunc
* unused func finder doesnt work perfectly on my projects. need add owning func!
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep


// Perry additions
* add image editor...
* skinning support? .HelloKitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
	* game-like IDE. functionality, "fix" using gameplay states. Mini-games that "Restore state". Do after the VM. Like collect items that are code and get unlocked in the right order...  that can't just be commented out.
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace?
	* syntactic-mode also
