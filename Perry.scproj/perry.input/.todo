* VM?
* RefOpts?
* Perry on Ubuntu?
	* first startup shouldn't have a wierd IDE with no doc... especially if you close the splash window
	* First proj open seems to not have the projects tab visible?
	* empty extras being added to fileviewer
		* because it can't find a root during adding it. if not found, it shouldn't just fail badly!
	* invalid argument when un-memmap
	* not reporting some shm_open errors properly on linux?
	* install g++, libsdl2-dev, gedit

// personal
* backup selftool and galaxxies... on git.

// Do later
* clearing errors from an active build (perhaps the error was a C++ compile error)... (cleared by just refreshing the error) seems to clear the build state too.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
