* VM?
* nil-checking seems a very good idea. shouldn't be too hard to do either!!
	* Mostly the issues will be around module variables...
* RefOpts?
* path differences...
	* if str contains "network" crash?
* Perry on Ubuntu?
	* install g++, libsdl2-dev, gedit
* Cmd-D doesnt work properly if you START OFF with "/" before search for files normally.
* control click is a right click!!! on linux. So how to cmd-click on things? (alt?)

// personal
* backup selftool and galaxxies... on git.


// Do later
* any object can be created with an virtual-function override thing, just store before the refcount?
* clearing errors from an active build (perhaps the error was a C++ compile error)... (cleared by just refreshing the error) seems to clear the build state too.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
