* VM?
* nil-checking seems a very good idea. shouldn't be too hard to do either!!
	* mostly the issues will be around module variables... structure this as some kinda "problem/solution" class...
* set self to anything... except in constructor/destructor!
* destructors should nil each variable... Just in case someone (ME) is doing wierd stuff
* any object can be created with an owner
* RefOpts?
* Perry on Ubuntu?
	* install g++, libsdl2-dev, gedit

// personal
* backup selftool and galaxxies... on git.

// Do later
* look into window calling .DisposeAll and it's memorymanagement
* clearing errors from an active build (perhaps the error was a C++ compile error)... (cleared by just refreshing the error) seems to clear the build state too.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
