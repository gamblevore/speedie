* changing a file to a folder or back again... fails to update in the IDE. TryReloadPath?
* jbbuild.sh should be auto-run by spd --self.
	* banned thing should mention the property/msg that reached us
	* .render is reaching process/file? lol. Via behaviours?
	* remove date from error... or at least change it for libs.


* invite tobias/simon to speedie collab
* build-system should INITIALLY not rely on the speedie executable... just a script built by speedie. :) with all the correct files needed.

* Speedie export asm funcs
	* Pack linking... at least a basic idea?
	* "conf:backup critical". perry/speedie/etc share backup approach

* Put off till later
	* Make logs hierarchical with timestamps
	* batch-find in a specific directory... maybe just piggyback off the main file-list...
	* graphics? like an editor?
		* temporal editor? choosing colors? pixels? textures?

* basic bugs / feature (needs users to sponsor)
	* TextView error/find resync
	* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
	* Find-replace!
		* syntactic-mode also
	* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
	* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
	* install permissions validation? /usr/local/bin should be owned by ':admin' and have mode 775

* contact
	* https://github.com/paypal/Checkout-PHP-SDK
	* multiplay. find others on youtube, and discord
