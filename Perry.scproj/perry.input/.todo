* VM?
* Perry is not displaying/getting speedie's build output very well
* nil-checking
	* make less noisy?
	* .NilUsage vs .Nildeclared
	* NilSweep, just for global vars
		
	


// Do later
* change "?" behaviour to use "if" not ternary. and maybe blocks...  a.b?.c.d.e  will not run  .c.d.e if !a
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* not-compilable functions blocks lookups, on a .dot function call.
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep
		* Start with leaf-funcs.
* skinning support? .hellokitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
* clearing errors from an active build (perhaps the error was a C++ compile error)... (cleared by just refreshing the error) seems to clear the build state too.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
