* VM? 
* nil-checking
	* NilSweep, for global vars, and for function misuse.


// Perry Do later
* uncommenting "     //   abc" doesnt work properly.
* can't right click on the returntype?
* clearing logs doesnt clear both speedie and perry
	* also speedie cant rebuild
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
* TextView error/find resync
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can


// Speedie Do later
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep
		* Start with leaf-funcs.
* "calledfrom" autocomplete needs to include references to funcs
	* calledfrom datatypes too
	* @dot completes to @dotAnyGlobalfunc
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* finding .func in "|| x = "abc".func" would need change to how decls are collected... 
	* Add decl.nextdecl (for contains) to store ALL init decls list... leave them in place. InitFuncs get copies.
* autocomplete in iterators using the yield_test func would be nice.


// Perry additions
* add image editor...
* reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/14eed4n medium.com hackernews?
* skinning support? .HelloKitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
	* game-like IDE. functionality, "fix" using gameplay states. Mini-games that "Restore state". Do after the VM. Like collect items that are code and get unlocked in the right order...  that can't just be commented out.
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace?
	* syntactic-mode also
