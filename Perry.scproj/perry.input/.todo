* VM?
* nil-checking seems a very good idea. shouldn't be too hard to do either!!
	* Mostly the issues will be around module variables...
* RefOpts?
* bigger lineheight for findfield?
* perry isn't opening files that were opened... anymore, at least not in front of the todo file
* batch-find could be a bit slicker... when selecting the group item or just doing the search itself. like clicking on a file should jump to the first item? and jumping to a project the same...




// Do later
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* not-compilable functions blocks lookups, on a .dot function call.
* any object can be created with an virtual-function override table, just store before the refcount?
* clearing errors from an active build (perhaps the error was a C++ compile error)... (cleared by just refreshing the error) seems to clear the build state too.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
