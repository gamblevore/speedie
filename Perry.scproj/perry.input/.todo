* VM?
* RefOpts?
* Speedie should set the chown and chmod of files/folders generated... if it is being run from sudo. Set to an acceptable state.

// personal
* backup selftool and galaxxies... on git.

// Do later
* clearing errors from an active build (perhaps the error was a C++ compile error)... (cleared by just refreshing the error) seems to clear the build state too.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* Make logs hierarchical with timestamps
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
