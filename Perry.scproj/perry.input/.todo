* VM?
* nil-checking
	* .NilUsage vs .Nildeclared
	* NilSweep, for global vars, and for function misuse.


// Speedie Do later
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep
		* Start with leaf-funcs.
* "calledfrom" autocomplete needs to include references to funcs
	* calledfrom datatypes too
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* compiling jz.spd seems to create an import of "@spd/Utils"??


// Perry Do later
* extra error is being added (first? is being saved? for some good reason but too enthusiastic)
* path menus fail to click ? (isa bug?)
* function list should have a field that can be typed into
* clicking on empty errorlist should take you to the filelist
* case completion fails in speedie?
* https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/14eed4n
* skinning support? .HelloKitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
