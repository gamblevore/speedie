* VM?
* nil-checking
	* .NilUsage vs .Nildeclared
	* NilSweep, for global vars, and for function misuse.


* 3~right does not click-jump
	* 3~ should autocomplete from the macros


// Do later
* x = ring.position? fails to compile
* change "?" implementation
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep
		* Start with leaf-funcs.
* CollectDecls needs fixing to not return early!! or break it up into pieces
* skinning support? .HelloKitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace!
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
