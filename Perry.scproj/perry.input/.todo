* VM? 
* nil-checking
	* NilSweep, for global vars, and for function misuse.
* constants and globals don't autocomplete nicely


// Perry Do later
* SelectedLine on startup is right at the top... so you can't see the lines above :(
	* pasting line-jumping acts different than typing line-jumping
// even later
* function jumping should be to a function + a relative line... not bytepos... due to editing of files making things messy.
	* What about decls? perhaps just relative to a node?
* TextView error/find resync
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* the cmm for files should have a cloc feature?


// Speedie Do later
* finish off collectdecls
* new datatypes can subclass off nothing!
* nicer lookups: fn x (|int| n), .x(max) --> .x(int.max) // assuming max doesn't exist locally.
	* just set a global var... somewhere, and do set .obj or whatever it is that we lookup from in lookupsub, to that var if we can't find anything... it should happen in priority to globals, though.
* "calledfrom" autocomplete needs to include references to funcs
	* calledfrom datatypes too
	* @dot completes to @dotAnyGlobalfunc
* unused func finder doesnt work perfectly on my projects. need add owning func!
* To make "dispatch" clickable, we need to alter MoveToInitFunc, so we have an init func per module per file.
* galaxxies C++ compile issues
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep


// Perry additions
* add image editor...
* skinning support? .HelloKitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
	* game-like IDE. functionality, "fix" using gameplay states. Mini-games that "Restore state". Do after the VM. Like collect items that are code and get unlocked in the right order...  that can't just be commented out.
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace?
	* syntactic-mode also
