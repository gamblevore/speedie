* VM?
* nil-checking
	* .NilUsage vs .Nildeclared
	* NilSweep, for global vars, and for function misuse.


// Speedie Do later
* RefOpts. Do it bit by bit
	* get property but only did math
	* mark a few string funcs as not-modifier/disowner/capturer
	* mark entire class
	* fast capture of disowned things. like: r1 <~ r2.pop
	* check entire program for modification during nil-sweep
		* Start with leaf-funcs.
* "calledfrom" autocomplete needs to include references to funcs
	* calledfrom datatypes too
	* @dot completes to @dotAnyGlobalfunc
* galaxxies C++ compile issues


// Perry Do later
* no need autocomplete decl names!!!
* extra error is being added (first? is being saved? for some good reason but too enthusiastic)
* if w isa P<tab>// no need to autocomplete things that w can't be.
* add image editor... using qoi format. Remove png from speedie!
* https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/14eed4n medium.com hackernews?
* skinning support? .HelloKitty or .emo file endings could reskin the IDE dynamically.
	* game-like IDE. Break functionality, "fix" using gameplay states. Mini-games that "Restore state". Do after the VM. Like collect items that are code and get unlocked in the right order... Something that can't just be commented out.
* TextView error/find resync
* double clicking |abc| on the || should sel the entire thing, doing on the inside should sel the inside
* Find-replace?
	* syntactic-mode also
* too long text in listview draw as much as we can
* First use of tab (in func) or () (to wrap) on opening perry doesn't work.
