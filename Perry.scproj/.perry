/*
Bloat fix plan:
	* remove dictionary, use fixeddict (needs leaf/stems)
	* some unnecessary visible funcs (JB_MzSt_Render)
	* objectloader, and saveable stuff (JB_StructSaveTest_destructor is unused?)
		* clean up and remove the special-rules around it? it was kinda ugly...
	* whole program ref analysis for remove refcounts.
	* remove dict.reverse in constants.spd
