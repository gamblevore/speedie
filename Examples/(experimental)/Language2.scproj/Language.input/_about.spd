/*
Design principles:
* unambiguous words read from Jeebox source.
	* Disambiguate same spellings, like: ver, _ver, ver_
	* or cool(temp) and cool(style)
* For text recognition, use the dictionary (with context) to disambiguate.
	* jb source stays unambiguous.

* Adjectives --> nouns
* Adverbs --> adjectives --> nouns
* Can't have two words of same grammatical type, on the same Group.
	* deep, deeper, deepest... have to have different types, or be different Groups.


* "_ go away" (imperative form. Also has a different lookup, for spanish.)
	* What about english... where: ("i go away" == "_ go away"). Needs same lookup!
		* "!go away" for spanish?
		* !veamos la~bird... spanish is gonna be full of ! all the time lol.
