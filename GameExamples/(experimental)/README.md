# Experimental Files #

The files in here are unfinished... and might not get attention for months, as I work on more important things.

These are just "fun side projects" to distract me... when I feel like I need a distraction. Still, I just want them savede to the github in case anything happens to my data, or I want to work on them from a different location!
